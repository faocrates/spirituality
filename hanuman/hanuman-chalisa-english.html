    <h2>Hanuman Chalisa - As I Know It</h2>


    <p>(by Dr Christos Bohoris)</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>1. Cleansing the mirror of my mind with the dust from the lotus feet of the Guru, I describe the unblemished
        glory of Rama that bestows the four fruits.</p>

    <p>2. Knowing this body to be devoid of intellect, I remember the son of the wind. Give me strength, intellect
        and knowledge and take away all afflictions and passions.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>1. Glory to Hanuman who is the ocean of knowledge and virtues. Glory to the leader of the monkeys, renowned
        in the three worlds.</p>

    <p>2. You are the messenger of Rama and the abode of incomparable strength. You are the son of Anjana, known as
        the son of the wind.</p>

    <p>3. You are a great hero, brave with a body like a diamond. You are the destroyer of ignorance and a companion
        of one whose intellect is pure.</p>

        is curly.</p>

    <p>5. You hold the thunderbolt and the flag in your hands. The sacred thread made of Munja grass adorns your
        shoulder.</p>

    <p>6. The embodiment of Shiva, the joy giving son of Kesari. Your greatness and abilities are praised by the
        whole world.</p>

    <p>8. You delight in listening to the Lord‘s story. Rama, Lakshman and Sita reside in your heart.</p>

    <p>9. You assumed a minute form and appeared to Sita. You assumed a huge, fearsome form and burned the city of
        Lanka.</p>

    <p>10. You assumed a terrifying form and destroyed the demons. You carried out all the tasks of Ramachandra.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>25. All disease is cured and all sufferings are removed with the continuous repetition of Hanuman’s brave
        name.
