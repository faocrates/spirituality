    <h2>Granddad's Message</h2>


    <p>(by Dr Christos Bohoris)</p>
<p>
My Child,<br />
My physical body is dead while my self lives eternally in ever present joy. The system around you is much more modern than the one I saw. The way you travel, get food, information or entertainment are all different. You also see around you scientists and popular people claiming they know better and know a lot about this world, change and the advancements of humanity. I want to tell you about a truth eternal of the existence of God, our oneness with God within a single consciousness, do not be mislead into a mental state of separation and isolation. Surround yourself with nature, God's creations. They form an intelligence, information and communication network that connects you with God. Experiment with yourself in meditation and discover the truth yourself, inside and around you. Live in inner freedom of the heart, expand and fill it with love divine, do not allow it to contract in sorrow and attachment. Choose the path to God that expresses you most and fear not, knowing that an enormous power is available to you, always one thought away.<br /><br />

Together in joy,<br />
Your Granddad
